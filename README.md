## My General Programming Philosophy
to help explain a large portion of my feedback & strategy when it comes to new projects, here are some of the philosophies / theories I follow from a programming perspective.  
[The rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming))  
[Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)  
[You Aren't Going To Need It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)  
[Keep It Stupid Simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)  
Keeping a [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)  
Avoid [Feature Creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) & [Overengineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering)

## How To Work With Me
I am very easy to work with as long as you 
1. Treat myself &  other's with respect.
2. Give constructive feedback to myself & others.
3. Participate in meetings & contribute to hitting sprint goals.
4. Aren't disruptful to the team hitting sprint goals.
5. Don't fail silently if you have "hit a wall" and get stuck ask for help, however I am not your personal wikipedia on how to program, if you haven't at least tried to figure it out on your own I will feel less inclined to help you. Especially if you are a frequent abuser to this rule. With that said I absolutely love to help & mentor those who need but I refuse to help those who don't try to help themselves.
6. Challenge my ideas & work with me to come up with new solutions to our problems.
7. If you have a problem with me personally or with work. Talk to me. We can't work on fixing bugs if no one reports an issue, in other words I am not a mind reader and I am a busy person, so if there are issues you want addressed make them known and I will work on them.
